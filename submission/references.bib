	abstract = {Critical issues related to gender disparity and bias must be examined by sound studies. Drawing upon our high-quality global data sources, analytical expertise and unique gender disambiguation methodology, Elsevier has produced this comprehensive new report, Gender in the Global Research Landscape, as an evidence-based examination of research performance worldwide through a gender lens and as a vehicle for understanding the role of gender within the structure of the global research enterprise. This free report covers 20 years, 12 geographies and 27 subject areas, providing powerful insight and guidance on gender research and gender equality policy for governments, funders and institutions worldwide. In addition to global results and trends, Gender in the Global Research Landscape includes thought-provoking interviews with global experts. The report is based on Elsevier’s SciVal and Scopus data combined with name data from social media, applied onomastics, and Wikipedia. The analyses were further informed by input from stakeholder organizations and individuals around the world including the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). We partnered with expert stakeholder organizations and individuals around the world to advise on the report’s development, including the research questions, methodologies, and analytics, and to provide a policy context for the report findings. Gender in the Global Research Landscape is a follow-on to Elsevier's groundbreaking 2015 report, Mapping Gender in the German Research Arena.},

	abstract = {The student and faculty make-up of academic institutions does not represent national demographics. Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately underrepresented nationally, and particularly at predominantly white institutions (PWIs). Although significant efforts and funding have been committed to increasing points of access or recruitment of under-represented minority (URM) students and faculty at PWIs, these individuals have not been recruited and retained at rates that reflect their national proportions. Underrepresentation of URMs is particularly prevalent in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This reality represents a national crisis given a predicted shortage of workers in STEM disciplines based on current rates of training of all individuals, majority and URM, and the intersection of this limitation with persistent challenges in the recruitment, training, retention and advancement of URMs who will soon represent the largest pool of future trainees. An additional compounding factor is the increasingly disproportionate underrepresentation of minorities at higher professorial and administrative ranks, thus limiting the pool of potential mentors who are correlated with successful shepherding of URM students through STEM training and development. We address issues related to improving recruitment and retention of URM faculty that are applicable across a range of academic institutions. We describe challenges with recruitment and retention of URM faculty and their advancement through promotion in the faculty ranks and into leadership positions. We offer specific recommendations, including identifying environmental barriers to diversity and implementing strategies for their amelioration, promoting effective and innovative mentoring, and addressing leadership issues related to constructive change for promoting diversity.},
