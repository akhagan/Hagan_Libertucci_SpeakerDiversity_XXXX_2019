	abstract = {Critical issues related to gender disparity and bias must be examined by sound studies. Drawing upon our high-quality global data sources, analytical expertise and unique gender disambiguation methodology, Elsevier has produced this comprehensive new report, Gender in the Global Research Landscape, as an evidence-based examination of research performance worldwide through a gender lens and as a vehicle for understanding the role of gender within the structure of the global research enterprise. This free report covers 20 years, 12 geographies and 27 subject areas, providing powerful insight and guidance on gender research and gender equality policy for governments, funders and institutions worldwide. In addition to global results and trends, Gender in the Global Research Landscape includes thought-provoking interviews with global experts. The report is based on Elsevier’s SciVal and Scopus data combined with name data from social media, applied onomastics, and Wikipedia. The analyses were further informed by input from stakeholder organizations and individuals around the world including the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). We partnered with expert stakeholder organizations and individuals around the world to advise on the report’s development, including the research questions, methodologies, and analytics, and to provide a policy context for the report findings. Gender in the Global Research Landscape is a follow-on to Elsevier's groundbreaking 2015 report, Mapping Gender in the German Research Arena.},
